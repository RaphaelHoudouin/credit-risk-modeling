Credit Risk Modeling and Scorecard Development
This repository demonstrates the development of a Credit Risk Model and a Credit Scorecard using Python. It utilizes historical loan data from 2007 to 2014 to predict the likelihood of loan defaults and create a credit scorecard for assessing the creditworthiness of applicants.

Project Overview
The main objectives of this project are:

Credit Risk Modeling: Build a model to predict the probability of loan default.
Scorecard Development: Use the model to create a credit scorecard that simplifies credit risk evaluation.
Project Structure
1. Environment Setup
Libraries:
pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, scikit-learn
Tools:
Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab
2. Data Import and Exploration
Dataset:
Historical loan data from Lending Club (2007â€“2014)
Tasks:
Initial data exploration, data type verification, null value analysis
3. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Handle missing values, remove redundant and forward-looking columns
Convert categorical data into numerical formats using dummy variables
4. Feature Selection
Techniques:
Chi-squared statistic for categorical features
ANOVA F-statistic for numerical features
Multicollinearity detection:
Pairwise correlations between top numerical features
5. Weight of Evidence (WoE) Binning
Apply WoE and Information Value (IV) transformations to improve model interpretability and performance
6. Model Development
Logistic Regression:
Chosen for its simplicity and interpretability
Performance Metrics:
Confusion matrix, ROC-AUC score, Precision-Recall curves
7. Credit Scorecard Development
Translate model outputs into a scoring framework for lenders
How to Use
1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copier le code
git clone https://github.com/username/credit-risk-model.git
cd credit-risk-model
2. Set Up the Environment
Install required dependencies:

bash
Copier le code
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the Project
Execute the Jupyter Notebook for step-by-step insights:

bash
Copier le code
jupyter notebook Credit_Risk_Model_and_Credit_Scorecard.ipynb
Or, run the Python script:

bash
Copier le code
python main.py
4. Outputs

A credit scorecard for evaluating loan applicants
Additional Notes
The credit scorecard is a simplified example for educational purposes.
The methodology can be applied to other datasets, but further validation is needed for real-world applications.
