# Credit Risk Modeling and Scorecard Development

This repository demonstrates the development of a Credit Risk Model and a Credit Scorecard using Python. It leverages historical loan data from 2007 to 2014 to predict the likelihood of a loan default and create a tool for assessing the creditworthiness of applicants.

## Project Overview

The main objectives of this project are:

1. **Credit Risk Modeling**: Build a model to predict the probability of loan default.
2. **Scorecard Development**: Use the model to create a credit scorecard that simplifies credit risk evaluation.

## Project Structure

### Environment Setup

**Libraries**: 
- pandas
- numpy
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

**Tools**:
- Jupyter Notebook
- Google Colab

### Data Import and Exploration

**Dataset**: 
- Historical loan data from Lending Club.

**Tasks**: 
- Initial data exploration
- Data type verification
- Null value analysis

### Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

- Handle missing values and remove redundant or forward-looking columns.
- Convert categorical data into numerical formats using dummy variables.

### Feature Selection

- **Techniques**: 
  - Chi-squared statistic for categorical features.
  - ANOVA F-statistic for numerical features.
- **Multicollinearity detection** through pairwise correlations.

### Weight of Evidence (WoE) Binning

- Apply WoE and Information Value (IV) transformations to improve model interpretability and performance.

### Model Development

- **Logistic Regression**: Chosen for its simplicity and interpretability.
- **Performance Metrics**: 
  - Confusion matrix
  - ROC-AUC score
  - Precision-Recall curves

### Credit Scorecard Development

- Translate model outputs into a scoring framework for lenders.

## How to Use

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/credit-risk-model.git
cd credit-risk-model

## How to Use

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/credit-risk-model.git
cd credit-risk-model
Set Up the Environment
Install required dependencies:

bash
Copier le code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Project
Execute the Jupyter Notebook for step-by-step insights:

bash
Copier le code
jupyter notebook Credit_Risk_Model_and_Credit_Scorecard.ipynb
Or, run the Python script:

bash
Copier le code
python main.py
Outputs
A trained logistic regression model.
A credit scorecard for evaluating loan applicants.
Additional Notes
The credit scorecard is a simplified example for educational purposes.
While the methodology can be applied to other datasets, further validation is needed for real-world applications.
This project does not constitute financial advice.
Results
Model Performance:
ROC-AUC: 0.85
Precision and Recall: 0.80, 0.85
Scorecard Insights:
Key thresholds for credit approval or rejection.
Visualization of risk levels.
